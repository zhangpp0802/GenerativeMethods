### Inspirations:
Heavily depend on Professor Compton's starter code.

### What is your generative space? (ie, what kinds of things can this generate?)

My generative spaces are faces, Ltree, fish and rectangle. Users can toggle between from the draw down menu at top left corner. The user can also play with the values given in different scenes.

### What do each of the sliders do?

For Faces: the sliders includes chin, jaw, chinWidth, cheekAngle, color, shade, width, height, eyeAngle, and eyeColor. 
For Ltrees: the sliders includes spread, energy, bushiness, length_dieoff, thickness_dieoff, flowerHue, petalSpread, flowerSize, and flowerSpikiness.
For Fish: the sliders includes streamline, size, hue, hueOffset, lumps, complexity, and deformation.
For Rectangle: the sliders includes width, height, hue, and angle.
