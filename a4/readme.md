* you can access by index.html.
* you are able to play with the sliders and drag some particles with simple mouse drag.

### Particle system 1: -- BasicParticleSystem --

* This can be view as a four white square gathered icon flying in the view.
* Starter code from Kate Compton.
* It get force from <basic-particles.js> file.
* Corresponding to three sliders (SquGravity, SquAttraction, SquDrag) in the view.
* To debug, try place the drop down to BasicParticleSystem instead of none
 
### Particle system 2: -- BoidsFlock -- 

* This can be view as the little light green arrows image in the view.
* Starter code from Kate Compton.
* It get force from <boids-particles.js> file.
* Corresponding to three sliders (avoidance, cohesion, alignment) in the view.
* To debug, try place the drop down to BoidsFlock instead of none

### Particle system 3: -- WindParticleSystem -- 

* This cannot be view directly but can be seen by finding the flowing pattern of the little transparent white dots.
* Starter code from Kate Compton.
* It get force from <wind-particles.js> file.
* Do not have slider for this.
* To debug, try place the drop down to WindParticleSystem instead of none

### Particle system 4: -- BraitenbergSystem -- 

* This can be view as the transparent insect image in the view.
* Starter code from Kate Compton.
* It get force from <braitenberg-particles.js> file.
* Corresponding to three sliders (InsectSpeed, InsectTurn, InsectDrag) in the view.
* To debug, try place the drop down to BraitenbergSystem instead of none

### Particle system 5: -- SelfPortrait -- 

* This cannot be seen directly. You can try click key "h" on the keyboard to see this particle. I did this because this particle might hinder the movement of other particles.
* Starter code from Kate Compton.
* It get force from <portrait-particles.js> file.
* Do not have slider for this.
* To debug, try place the drop down to SelfPortrait instead of none

### One related thought from the reading:
From the boid particle system readings, I understand more about how seperation aligniment and cohesion work with the particle system. It is really inspiring because it made me think of the randomness of entropy and how molecule move in real life.
