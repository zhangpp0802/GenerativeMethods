### Quotes from paper
"A more appropriate description should mirror the ‘natural ontology’ of the software's design, including elements such as lines, brushes and colour. Our framework uses natural language descriptions and definitions. It is not a mathematical theory with axioms, lemmas and proofs. It is simply a useful way of describing, and seeking to understand, certain aspects of a wide class of creative works."
